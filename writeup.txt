If I had to build a full-scale web application, I would do several things. I would remove all the hard coded settings and make them configurable (endpoint, page size, filtering attributes). This way a user could easily configure how they want their data to display. I would add functionality to let the user go forward/backward/exit. I started writing that functionality and made the code easy to upgrade for those features. I would separate the data response and the function that treats the data more so that it each piece could be easily tested. I would add some kind of caching for the network response, localstorage might work for this. If the user were to check multiple times in a day, multiple requests to the Food Truck API are not necessary.
